<h2 align="center">Project Description:-</h2>

- The Python Lab Project is a comprehensive exercise that incorporates multiple Python programming concepts and techniques.
<p align="center"><b> It consists of the following components:</b></p>

<h2>Module 1:</h2>

- This module focuses on foundational Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions.

<h2>Module 2:</h2>

- In this module, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are explored. 
- It includes the creation of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

<h2>Module 3: </h2>

- The third module delves into file handling and exception handling techniques in Python.
-  It emphasizes reading and writing data from/to files and handling various types of exceptions gracefully.

<h2>Module 4:</h2> 

- The fourth module introduces the concept of modules and packages. 
- It demonstrates the utilization of existing Python libraries and the creation of custom modules for code organization and reusability.
